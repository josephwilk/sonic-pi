## The Live Coding Synth for Everyone.

Sonic Pi is a new kind of musical instrument. Instead of strumming
strings or whacking things with sticks - you write code - live.

Sonic Pi has been designed with the aim to find a harmonious balance
between three core principles:

* *Simple* enough for the 10 year old inside you
* *Joyful* enough for you to lose yourself through play
* *Powerful* enough for your own expressions

Powering Sonic Pi is an open source programming environment originally
designed to explore and teach programming concepts through the process
of creating new sounds. Whilst maintainig Education as a core focus it
now sits at the intersection between three core domains:

* *Education* 
* *Technology*
* *Art*

Again, finding a balance working to the best benefits of all these
domains is is the objective.


Sonic Pi comes with an associated scheme of work
which emphasises the importance of creativity in the learning process
and gives users the control to turn their sonic ideas into reality.

However, in addition to being an engaging education resource it's also
evolved into an extremely powerful and performance-ready live coding
instrument suitable for professional artists and DJs.
